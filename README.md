 * [x] Design an activity layout
 * [x] Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

# Common Project Requirements
 * [x] App is written solely in the Java Programming Language
 * [x] App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines NOTE:
 It is okay if the app does not handle rotation properly or does not restore the data using onSaveInstanceState/onRestoreInstanceState)
 * [x] Submission must use stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio.
 Debug/beta/canary versions are not acceptable.
